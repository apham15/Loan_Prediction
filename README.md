## Loan_Prediction

Lending Club is "the world's largest online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors." It is a peer-to-peer lending network that open sources some of its loan data to the community.

During this analyze I'll use the loan.csv file that contains real-world, historical data on loans organized by Lending Club between 2007 and 2011.

#In this projec, I did perform all the basic but necessary steps to make the audience understanding EDA process, apply Supervised Learning Models to predict the loan status with all the features.

* Import libraries and dataset
* Understand the data
* Apply descriptive analysis and visualization to give some insigh of the raw data
* Determine the features and the target (Loan Status)
* Clean the data 
* Apply feature engineering (PCA)
* Using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Models to determine the preditction
* The best model that fit the dataset is Randome Forest with 96% accuracy
