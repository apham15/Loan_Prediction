Lending Club is "the world's largest online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors." It is a peer-to-peer lending network that open sources some of its loan data to the community.

During this analyze I'll use the loan.csv file that contains real-world, historical data on loans organized by Lending Club between 2007 and 2011.
